                        involvement with the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB). As a Tomorrow’s Leaders
                        Representative for the Cape Town Hub, she has been actively engaged in promoting the
                        development of young professionals in the construction industry. Her role involves allowing
                        spaces for mentorship and guiding emerging talents, and opportunity to grow in their
                        professional standards and practices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Tadiwa’s dedication and leadership skills were recognized when she was invited as a delegate
                        to the CIOB Members’ Forum. This prestigious invitation allowed her to participate in
                        discussions and decision-making processes that shape the future of the construction industry.
                        In addition to her role as a delegate, Tadiwa was also voted into the Member Engagement
                        Committee. This position underscores her ability to connect with members and foster a sense
                        of community within the CIOB. At the Members’ Forum, Tadiwa actively participated in
                        discussions and decision-making processes that shape the future of the construction
                        industry. Her insights and contributions were highly valued, reflecting her deep commitment

                        community. In this role, she focuses on enhancing member engagement and ensuring that
                        the voices of young professionals are heard and addressed. Her efforts in this committee are
                        a testament to her dedication to the professional development of her peers and the broader
                        construction community. One of the highlights of Tadiwa’s journey was her trip to London for
                        a member engagement meeting. This visit provided her with a unique opportunity to
                        represent the Tomorrow’s Leaders and share her experiences and insights with a global
                        audience. During her time in London, she also visited Construction projects, gaining valuable

                        Driven by her passion for interior design and the built environment, she renovated a
                        reading/playroom for pre-school students. This project not only showcased her enthusiasm
                        and creativity but also her commitment to improving her community. The renovation
                        provided a better learning environment for the children and highlighted Tadiwa’s ability to
